# GoComplaint

**GoComplaint** is a platform to report complaints related to public-services or issues. Thus, the complaint will be easily followed up by the government and take action on the report based on the priority, seen from the level of urgency.

**Why:** Due to the difficulty in getting a quick government response and lack of citizen participation.

**Problem Statement:** We decided to develop this system in response to the prevalent inefficiencies in handling public service-related complaints across diverse regions in Indonesia. The existing challenges plus the lack of centralized data, have impeded the government's capacity to prioritize and address pressing issues.

**Research Question:** How to improve the efficiency of government response to public complaints for improving infrastructure quality and increase public satisfaction with government performance?

**Background Information:** The ineffectiveness of facilities in their development, mismatch between a governance system and the residents, and the government's performance not aligning with the community's needs have prompted residents to express their opinions on these matters. The absence of a platform to accommodate such aspirations leaves the public perplexed. GoComplaint is a complaint system that collects citizens' grievances and processes this data into user-friendly information (prioritizing issues based on various conditions, e.g., the number of complaints, accident risks).
